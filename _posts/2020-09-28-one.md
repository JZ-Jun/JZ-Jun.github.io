I started writing these reflections at the beginning of my PhD to capture lessons I might otherwise forget. I have never been good at taking notes (I once believed I had a good memory and didn’t need notes...turns out, not really..), so I want to document these moments here as memories of my research journey. Here is a short reflection on the first lesson I learned from my advisor and how it shaped the way I think about research.

### **What I Learned About Research**

I began my research journey the summer before starting my master’s at UC Irvine. Back then, I had no sense of what research meant. I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to do on a project, and I didn’t even know where to find the ACM Digital Library. The very first lessons my advisor shared with me gave me a broad picture of what research is and what it takes to do it.

**So, What is Research?**  
At its core, research is about asking the right questions: What are you doing? Why are you doing this? How are you doing this? From there, it becomes a process of shaping the project, selecting appropriate methods, carrying out the work of analysis, and finally, communicating the results. Research is not about rushing to answers—it is about building a thoughtful process that connects questions, methods, and contributions.

Key takeaways:

- Start with the questions: What are you doing? Why are you doing this? How are you doing this?
- Formulating the project.
- Formulating the methods/ Choosing and applying methods (executing the work and analyzing data).
- Writing up the findings/data.

**Lessons from Doing Research**  
I was frustrated when I worked on my first project for many reasons. One of them was that the project timeline felt so long, and I kept going back and forth doing data analysis over and over again. At one point, I honestly just wanted to give up. That was when my advisor reminded me that academic research is all about patience. I began to realize another lesson my advisor often emphasized: progress takes time, and results are not always immediate. What matters is staying committed and steady.

Back then, I was not a detail-oriented person before, and I did not fully understand the purpose of planning and goal-setting. I remember that during the first few meetings with my advisor, I sent her a document with just a few sentences summarizing the project. Looking back, I can see how confusing that must have been. I’ve since learned that being detail-oriented in research isn’t just for yourself. It’s about making your ideas clear enough that others can follow and understand your thinking.

Key takeaways:

- Research requires initiative. It is really about getting the work done.
- Working on research is a serious commitment. It asks for persistence and responsibility over the long term.
- Being detail-oriented is critical. Small things matter, and overlooking them can change the outcome.
- Making progress toward a Ph.D. means setting clear goals and staying mindful of them.
- Building routines, habits, and priorities that you will not compromise on makes it easier to stay on track.
