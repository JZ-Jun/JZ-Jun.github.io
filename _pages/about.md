I am a second-year M.S. student in the [Informatics Department](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine, advised by [Dr.Elena Agapie](https://eagapie.com/). Previously, I also completed my B.S Informatics at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/).

My research focuses on the areas of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Health Informatics**, and **Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW)**. Specifically, I am passionate about adopting **human-centered design (HCD)** principles to create and develop innovative health/wellness technologies to facilitate `healthy behaviors` from a `social-technical perspective`, especially for `underserved populations`. I am interested in exploring how these technologies could be designed and implemented effectively in `real-world` applications.

My ultimate aim in life is to utilize technology to make the world a better place for everyone. I firmly believe that technology alone cannot bring about change; it is people who have the ability to do so. While technological advancements can be made, true transformation requires people to take action and shape the story.

I may be stubborn, but consistency is all I ask. Outside school, you'll find me:  
Snowboarding. Playing board games and video games. Immersing myself in the Lego world. Spending time with my cat, Kitson.
