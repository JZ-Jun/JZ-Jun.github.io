I am a first year PhD student in [Information & Media](https://comartsci.msu.edu/departments/media-and-information) at Michigan State University, advised by [Dr. Megh Marathe](https://marathem.weebly.com/).

My research focuses on the areas of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Health Informatics**, and **Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW)**. Specifically, I study the `everyday experiences` of how people use technology to manage their `health conditions` (e.g., how people engage with and make sense of health data). I use human-centered approaches to design, build, and evaluate inclusive `sociotechnical systems` with people, emphasizing collaboration rather than one-sided solutions.

I completed a MS in [informatics](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/) at [University of California Irvine](https://uci.edu/), advised by [Dr. Elena Agapie](https://eagapie.com/). I am also fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Corina Sas](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/corina-sas) and [Dr. Daniel Epstein](https://depstein.net/).

Why research/HCI? I grew up in a generation shaped by technology. While rapid technological development has made life easier in many ways, it has also created new challenges for some people. My ultimate goal is to use scientific methods and technical skills to explore how technology can better serve people, creating work that makes a real impact on the world.

Outside school, you'll find me:  
Snowboarding. Playing video games, and Legos.
