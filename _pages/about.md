I am a second-year M.S. student in the [Informatics Department](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine, advised by [Dr.Elena Agapie](https://eagapie.com/). Previously, I also completed my B.S Informatics at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/).

My broad research interest is in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Human-Center Design(HCD)**, **Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW)**, and **Health Informatics**. Specifically, I am passionate about designing and developing innovative healthcare technologies to facilitate **positive behavior** and support **underserved populations**. I am interested in how to make technology more **inclusive** and **equitable** to better support people's ability to interpret the social context of their health condition. Additionally, how we can, as facilitators, design and implement technology more effectively and apply the outcomes in a real-world setting.

My ultimate aim in life is to utilize technology to make the world a better place for everyone. I firmly believe that technology alone cannot bring about change; it is people who have the ability to do so. While technological advancements can be made, true transformation requires people to take action and shape the story.

I may be stubborn, but consistency is all I ask. Outside school, you'll find me:  
Snowboarding. Playing video/computer games (The Legend of Zelda/League of Legends). Obsessing with the Lego world. Spending time with my cat, Kitson.
