I am a second-year M.S. student in the [Informatics Department](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine, advised by [Dr.Elena Agapie](https://eagapie.com/). I am also fortunate to be mentored by [Dr.Corina Sas](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/corina-sas), [Dr. Daniel Epstein](https://depstein.net/) and [Dr. Megh Marathe](https://marathem.weebly.com/). Previously, I also completed my B.S Informatics at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/).

My research focuses on the areas of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Health Informatics**, and **Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW)**. Specifically, I am interested in adopting **human-centered design** and leveraging technological innovations to address `socio-technical problems`, particularly for `marginalized populations`. I am passionate about researching how health technologies can be improved to enhance clinical and public health care and support healthy behaviors.

Why research? My ultimate goal is to use my research and technical skills to inspire others to pursue long-term health interventions that are both impactful and far-reaching, while also making technology more accessible to all.

I am persistent. I might be stubborn, but all I ask for is consistency. Outside school, you'll find me:  
Snowboarding. Playing board games and video games. Immersing myself in the Lego world. Spending time with my cats, Kitson and Union.
