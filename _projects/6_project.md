**Duration**: Jan 2023 - Mar 2023     
**Description**: This study examined the experience of older adults with visual impairments in acquiring and adapting to smartphones. This interview-based study provides insights into their challenges, available resources, and social support networks. The study suggests ways to improve the adoption process of smartphones for this population.

**Research Question**: As older adults who are blind and low vision(BLV) adopt a new smartphone, what considerations do they make, and what resources do they utilize?

**Method**: We interviewed 5 older adults who are BLV and are 60+ years of age. All participants are iPhone users.

**Findings**: BLV older adults are motivated to learn to use smartphones, and they encounter three challenges in doing so:
- Friend's smartphone stories contradict the reality of the smartphone after acquisition.
- Operating smartphones with a screen reader requires **expert-level** knowledge.
- The assistive technology aspect of smartphones can be isolating for BLV older adults.

**Design Implications**:
- Shared experience of smartphones that does not isolate smartphone screen reader users.
- Education around awareness of accessibility features.
- More accessible, intuitive terminology.

**Future Work**:
Further understanding
1. The learning practices and social support systems of this population.
2. How using smartphones impacts identity.
